# Caesar-Cypher-Bruteforce
Some code that will bruteforce a Caesar cypher. Not much else. My first project so it may be messy and may have bugs. Tried my best to debug.
How To Use:
1: Simply type in or paste in the ciphered text. For now, having numbers in there will probably break the program so no numbers. Special characters should work and should not break the program.
2: Press enter and there is your result.

GUI:
Gui is pretty straightforward. Same function but easy to the eye.
